Bot: hahahaha
User: i rate this debate a 7/10 -- actually ended
Bot: alright
User: clearly lmao
Bot: I think we just misunderstood each other lol
User: No yeah
Bot: everyone deserves therapy equally
User: deserving therapy isn‚Äôt a thing
Bot: ^
User: just require
Bot: Not deserve
User: What I'm getting is you guys think some people deserve it more than others and I disagree
Bot: some just require more of it
User: yeah, not denying that
Bot: But everyone deserves therapy equally
User: but you're arguing everyone should go to therapy?
Bot: If you think you'll just take up time then don't go
User: yeah it is
Bot: That's up to personal opinion really
User: bottled up is never good but yes I agree that‚Äôs my point
Bot: i don't disagree. but if you have minimal issues that can be resolved or bottled up without causing any serious harm long-term then you shouldn't take up resources that can be spent on someone who needs it more
User: that does not mean that a qualified professional won‚Äôt know how you can fix it on your own
Bot: If you went to therapy for a specific problem it's usually because you can't solve it on your own
User: why do you think that
Bot: Yes
User: do you think any therapist would take you if you told them your biggest problems were ones that could easily be fixed by not just therap
Bot: Wether you have small or big problems therapy is always good
User: even if you have some problems you can fix a lot and not go to therapy
Bot: mhm
User: but people have good mental health without therapy
Bot: Noone is a perfect human
User: goodbye syne!!
Bot: cya syne
User: why do you doubt that
Bot: I gtg cya guys
User: every few years maybe, but you shouldn't take time that can be used to help someone who needs it if you dont need it
Bot: No offense but I very much doubt you're mental health is perfect
User: yeah
Bot: It's not something you want to evade or smth
User: how will it help if you don‚Äôt have problems
Bot: yeah
User: Therapy is a good thing
Bot: at least it‚Äôs a qualified stranger
User: Wether you have mental issues or not
Bot: Everyone should go to therapy
User: fr
Bot: I don't wanna talk to a stranger about my life problems
User: absolutely
Bot: like if you need to go to therapy you should but like I'm glad I don't lol
User: most people don‚Äôt have to though
Bot: yeah
User: its good not having to, but bad not going when you should
Bot: umm in most cases it is a good thing I think
User: I just don't like it lol
Bot: If anything it's the other way around
User: Not going to therapy isn't a good thing
Bot: I've never been to therapy (thankfully)
User: good point
Bot: helpful sure, but not fun
User: therapy typically isnt fun
Bot: was it not fun
User: ah okay
Bot: like 30m
User: lol idk
Bot: like istg i go outside and it looks dead
User: how long was it?
Bot: why does any country look good when you google it üò≠
User: it's kinda boring but it's a cool place where I live ig
Bot: I've lived in the same us state and area for my entire life lmao
User: aha
Bot: and it seems cool
User: cuz my family is from there
Bot: why switzerland?
User: üá®üá≠
Bot: I wanna move to switzerland lol
User: yeah
Bot: usa is kinda in shambles rn
User: europe is pretty cool
Bot: we found it
User: I wish I was in Europe or smth lol
Bot: üá∏üá™
User: oh
Bot: didnt find a swedish flag in the emojis
User: sweden
Bot: nope
User: wait do you live in the us?
Bot: I mean you don't even have to feel like trans in your childhood to be trans
User: that sounds so dumb
Bot: and i have to go back next week :/
User: weird
Bot: they asked me a bunch of questions about my childhood, my identity online, and habits. felt like they were checking off a list
User: lol
Bot: thats crazy
User: i feel like half of the people here are 14
Bot: yeah
User: you're 14?
Bot: what is the therapy even supposed to do
User: yeah
Bot: wait that means me and nix are the same age
User: literally would rather buy them than get them for free with the tax system here
Bot: so just sell them to people 18+
User: but like you can start the therapy before 18, but you can't get the hormones before then
Bot: oh cool
User: i'm 16
Bot: how old are you anyway
User: I mean I get since you're under 18 they are trying to protect younger ppl ig but like it should just be you can get them with permission from like a parent or guardian or smth if you're under 18 but that might not work either cuz of unsupportive parents ig so there's not really any good solutions besides wait till you're 18
Bot: yeah
User: so they have to convince themself that you are trans or smth
Bot: they should just sell the hormones instead of this long process. we live in a capitalist society anyway
User: cause why would you even seek this therapy otherwise :/
Bot: pretty sure everyone tries to convince them that you are trans
User: it is
Bot: that sounds dumb
User: so it's like a test or smth lol
Bot: dang
User: well naturally
Bot: thank yous <3
User: well good luck
Bot: oh okay
User: then
Bot: i was prolly joking rhen
User: you did
Bot: did i say ‚Äúthose drugs‚Äù?
User: and the volcano
Bot: in your old house with all the areas
User: huh?
Bot: you said you were on "those drugs"
User: i asked you once
Bot: oh
User: nope
Bot: were you never on hormones?
User: Oh wel good luck in therapy
Bot: but i can start with the therapy before 18
User: no
Bot: U can start hormones before 18?
User: i hope it doesn't keep you away from huffing that estrogen for too long
Bot: yeah ig
User: that's somewhat fair i guess
Bot: oh
User: they need to make sure you‚Äôre actually trans -_-
Bot: its part of the process to get hormones
User: who told you that now
Bot: oh
User: apparently i need to go to therapy now :/

Bot: It might be my ancestry
User: IM JEALOUS
Bot: ame u have such unique features
User: with light hair
Bot: idk where it went
User: bcs my skin gets dark
Bot: when i was a child my hair was white
User: yeah but it looks so weird
Bot: yes its normal
User: my hair turns lighter in the sun yes
Bot: my skin gets dark with lightish hair so it looks unatrual
User: in summer people think i get highlights bccs some of my hairs turn super light but I dont
Bot: whaaa
User: what does that have to do with blondes
Bot: im very fair i can show u a picture tho
User: brown is the best
Bot: thats true
User: again
Bot: datk brown
User: nahhh don‚Äôt do it
Bot: creative outburst frrr
User: its also very cool like that cause a person has to really look at u in rhe eyes to notice
Bot: highlights is different then a full head bleach
User: they look really good with highlights tho
Bot: yeah its pretty cool in the sunlight
User: ITS SO COOL
Bot: ive never seen anyone that naturally has dark brown look better with blonde
User: his is very subtle too, i noticed it just 2 years ago
Bot: YES ITS STILL SO COOL
User: whats your natrual hair color
Bot: why would you dye your hair blond
User: now i have one blonde streak
Bot: it was blonde in asymmetrical pieces and i dyed most back to my natural hair color
User: for life
Bot: I wish it was more dramatic though
User: bleach has my hair screaming
Bot: its very subtle
User: its not diffrent eye colors
Bot: what color
User: THATS SO FUCKING COOL AME
Bot: the other is slightly lighter
User: one is slightly darker with a diffrent pattern
Bot: i bleached my hair and i have it now :)
User: my eyes also do what your dads do
Bot: i wont
User: maybe you will get it
Bot: ROBBED
User: NONE
Bot: and i got NONE of those
User: dads eyes are different shades of brown, one is slightly darker than the other and mom has like a streak (??????) of white hair growing, naturally
Bot: swamp color
User: its like this really weird
Bot: well indoors mine are not brown
User: i love brown eyes!
Bot: how
User: what
Bot: they do, but indoors they are boring
User: LITERALLY
Bot: Again
User: I was robbed

Bot: i have dark brown eyes
User: stupid
Bot: got recessive instead
User: should be a dominant gene but
Bot: ouuuuh
User: dark eyes would be sick tho
Bot: like gold and amber
User: mine just blue
Bot: my mother had dark eyes and my dad has blue eyes
User: feel bad to me
Bot: so like amber?
User: lotion and sunscreen
Bot: sunscreen
User: since my dad has dark eyes and my mom has blue eyes
Bot: what do u not like about unscreen
User: my eyes are medium color
Bot: just not likely
User: i mean it‚Äôs possible
Bot: ive seen a roma person with very light blue eyes and it was strange
User: cant even feel it bro
Bot: yes it does
User: no it doesn‚Äôt
Bot: it does
User: if u get right brand
Bot: sunscreen doesn‚Äôt feel terrible
User: but alright
Bot: sunscreen feels terrible
User: apply sunscreen during summer and u wont have suxh a drastic change
Bot: hence why it‚Äôs unnatural most of the time
User: its annoying having it change
Bot: people with dark skin are born that way because they live or lived closer to the sun (their ancestors) having blue eyes would go against tjay, because blue eyes are extremely sensitive to the light
User: my skin changes from like north europe to super dark
Bot: tanning is normal
User: because it is unnatural most of the time
Bot: could work if you know how to take care of ur hair.-.
User: not super dark
Bot: i meant a bit darker
User: change depending on the season
Bot: like my skin color, hair color, and even hair texture
User: light eyes dark skin looks kinda unnatural and scary
Bot: with those blue eyes
User: would look better
Bot: the original white supremacist
User: wym
Bot: i think a bit darker skin
User: wow they are so light
Bot: 
User: this bkue is prettier than
Bot: ugly
User: changes
Bot: 
User: depending on the season
Bot: it change too much
User: yes green is so much prettier than blue
Bot: Im not content with mine

User: (some of this may be outdated or incorrect when you are reading this)
Bot: @everyone
User: ## Regarding Hypixel‚Äôs new rule enforcements
Bot: You may or may not have seen the news, Hypixel just announced some new rules for Housing and Skyblock. Including; No Political Content (rip trump fb, you will not be missed), No Copyrighted Content, No scripting for an advantage (they removed HTSL).
User: 
Bot: ## What does this mean for us?
User: Well.. I‚Äôm not too sure yet. Currently, FreeBuilds are no more primarily due to the ‚ÄúNo Copyrighted Content‚Äù rule, but these rules may change in the near future. One can hope anyway. I haven‚Äôt spoken with <@1250503193260200088> about this yet, but Meila's FB; FreeForm hostings will be cancelled until we learn what we can and can‚Äôt do. Hopefully we will be able to host in the future.

Bot: I think we just misunderstood each other lol
User: No yeah
Bot: everyone deserves therapy equally
User: deserving therapy isn‚Äôt a thing
Bot: ^
User: just require
Bot: Not deserve
User: What I'm getting is you guys think some people deserve it more than others and I disagree
Bot: some just require more of it
User: yeah, not denying that
Bot: But everyone deserves therapy equally
User: but you're arguing everyone should go to therapy?
Bot: If you think you'll just take up time then don't go
User: yeah it is
Bot: That's up to personal opinion really
User: bottled up is never good but yes I agree that‚Äôs my point
Bot: i don't disagree. but if you have minimal issues that can be resolved or bottled up without causing any serious harm long-term then you shouldn't take up resources that can be spent on someone who needs it more
User: that does not mean that a qualified professional won‚Äôt know how you can fix it on your own
Bot: If you went to therapy for a specific problem it's usually because you can't solve it on your own
User: why do you think that
Bot: Yes
User: do you think any therapist would take you if you told them your biggest problems were ones that could easily be fixed by not just therap
Bot: Wether you have small or big problems therapy is always good
User: even if you have some problems you can fix a lot and not go to therapy
Bot: mhm
User: but people have good mental health without therapy
Bot: Noone is a perfect human
User: goodbye syne!!
Bot: cya syne
User: why do you doubt that
Bot: I gtg cya guys
User: every few years maybe, but you shouldn't take time that can be used to help someone who needs it if you dont need it
Bot: No offense but I very much doubt you're mental health is perfect
User: yeah
Bot: It's not something you want to evade or smth
User: how will it help if you don‚Äôt have problems
Bot: yeah
User: Therapy is a good thing
Bot: at least it‚Äôs a qualified stranger
User: Wether you have mental issues or not
Bot: Everyone should go to therapy
User: fr
Bot: I don't wanna talk to a stranger about my life problems
User: absolutely
Bot: like if you need to go to therapy you should but like I'm glad I don't lol
User: most people don‚Äôt have to though
Bot: yeah
User: its good not having to, but bad not going when you should
Bot: umm in most cases it is a good thing I think
User: I just don't like it lol
Bot: If anything it's the other way around
User: Not going to therapy isn't a good thing
Bot: I've never been to therapy (thankfully)
User: good point
Bot: helpful sure, but not fun
User: therapy typically isnt fun
Bot: was it not fun
User: ah okay
Bot: like 30m
User: lol idk
Bot: like istg i go outside and it looks dead
User: how long was it?
Bot: why does any country look good when you google it üò≠
User: it's kinda boring but it's a cool place where I live ig
Bot: I've lived in the same us state and area for my entire life lmao
User: aha
Bot: and it seems cool
User: cuz my family is from there
Bot: why switzerland?
User: üá®üá≠
Bot: I wanna move to switzerland lol
User: yeah
Bot: usa is kinda in shambles rn
User: europe is pretty cool

User: oh
Bot: didnt find a swedish flag in the emojis
User: sweden
Bot: nope
User: wait do you live in the us?
Bot: I mean you don't even have to feel like trans in your childhood to be trans
User: that sounds so dumb
Bot: and i have to go back next week :/
User: weird
Bot: they asked me a bunch of questions about my childhood, my identity online, and habits. felt like they were checking off a list
User: lol
Bot: thats crazy
User: i feel like half of the people here are 14
Bot: yeah
User: you're 14?
Bot: what is the therapy even supposed to do
User: yeah
Bot: wait that means me and nix are the same age
User: literally would rather buy them than get them for free with the tax system here
Bot: so just sell them to people 18+
User: but like you can start the therapy before 18, but you can't get the hormones before then
Bot: oh cool
User: i'm 16
Bot: how old are you anyway
User: I mean I get since you're under 18 they are trying to protect younger ppl ig but like it should just be you can get them with permission from like a parent or guardian or smth if you're under 18 but that might not work either cuz of unsupportive parents ig so there's not really any good solutions besides wait till you're 18
Bot: yeah
User: so they have to convince themself that you are trans or smth
Bot: they should just sell the hormones instead of this long process. we live in a capitalist society anyway
User: cause why would you even seek this therapy otherwise :/
Bot: pretty sure everyone tries to convince them that you are trans
User: it is
Bot: that sounds dumb
User: so it's like a test or smth lol
Bot: dang
User: well naturally
Bot: thank yous <3
User: well good luck
Bot: oh okay
User: then
Bot: i was prolly joking rhen

Bot: you said you were on "those drugs"
User: i asked you once
Bot: oh
User: nope
Bot: were you never on hormones?
User: Oh wel good luck in therapy
Bot: but i can start with the therapy before 18
User: no
Bot: U can start hormones before 18?
User: i hope it doesn't keep you away from huffing that estrogen for too long
Bot: yeah ig
User: that's somewhat fair i guess
Bot: oh
User: they need to make sure you‚Äôre actually trans -_-
Bot: its part of the process to get hormones
User: who told you that now
Bot: oh
User: apparently i need to go to therapy now :/

Bot: idk where it went
User: bcs my skin gets dark
Bot: when i was a child my hair was white
User: yeah but it looks so weird
Bot: yes its normal
User: my hair turns lighter in the sun yes
Bot: my skin gets dark with lightish hair so it looks unatrual
User: in summer people think i get highlights bccs some of my hairs turn super light but I dont
Bot: whaaa
User: what does that have to do with blondes
Bot: im very fair i can show u a picture tho
User: brown is the best
Bot: thats true
User: again
Bot: datk brown
User: nahhh don‚Äôt do it
Bot: creative outburst frrr
User: its also very cool like that cause a person has to really look at u in rhe eyes to notice
Bot: highlights is different then a full head bleach
User: they look really good with highlights tho
Bot: yeah its pretty cool in the sunlight
User: ITS SO COOL
Bot: ive never seen anyone that naturally has dark brown look better with blonde
User: his is very subtle too, i noticed it just 2 years ago
Bot: YES ITS STILL SO COOL
User: whats your natrual hair color
Bot: why would you dye your hair blond
User: now i have one blonde streak
Bot: it was blonde in asymmetrical pieces and i dyed most back to my natural hair color
User: for life
Bot: I wish it was more dramatic though
User: bleach has my hair screaming
Bot: its very subtle
User: its not diffrent eye colors
Bot: what color
User: THATS SO FUCKING COOL AME
Bot: the other is slightly lighter
User: one is slightly darker with a diffrent pattern
Bot: i bleached my hair and i have it now :)
User: my eyes also do what your dads do
Bot: i wont
User: maybe you will get it
Bot: ROBBED
User: NONE
Bot: and i got NONE of those
User: dads eyes are different shades of brown, one is slightly darker than the other and mom has like a streak (??????) of white hair growing, naturally
Bot: swamp color

Bot: sunscreen
User: since my dad has dark eyes and my mom has blue eyes
Bot: what do u not like about unscreen

User: cant even feel it bro
Bot: yes it does
User: no it doesn‚Äôt
Bot: it does
User: if u get right brand
Bot: sunscreen doesn‚Äôt feel terrible
User: but alright
Bot: sunscreen feels terrible
User: apply sunscreen during summer and u wont have suxh a drastic change
Bot: hence why it‚Äôs unnatural most of the time
User: its annoying having it change
Bot: people with dark skin are born that way because they live or lived closer to the sun (their ancestors) having blue eyes would go against tjay, because blue eyes are extremely sensitive to the light
User: my skin changes from like north europe to super dark
Bot: tanning is normal
User: because it is unnatural most of the time
Bot: could work if you know how to take care of ur hair.-.
User: not super dark
Bot: i meant a bit darker
User: change depending on the season
Bot: like my skin color, hair color, and even hair texture
User: light eyes dark skin looks kinda unnatural and scary
Bot: with those blue eyes
User: would look better
Bot: the original white supremacist
User: wym
Bot: i think a bit darker skin
User: wow they are so light
Bot: 
User: this bkue is prettier than
Bot: ugly

User: After the recent rules change, tons of people were against these rules, and with all this protest we actually got the rules reverted to their original state!
Bot: 
User: This means you can do everything you previously could, but these rules are said to be changed in the near future.
Bot: 
User: Due to this, hosting will be as usual; on a random schedule (whenever <@1250503193260200088> feels like it ig).

Bot: @everyone Fuck Hypixel
User: (some of this may be outdated or incorrect when you are reading this)
Bot: @everyone
User: ## Regarding Hypixel‚Äôs new rule enforcements
Bot: You may or may not have seen the news, Hypixel just announced some new rules for Housing and Skyblock. Including; No Political Content (rip trump fb, you will not be missed), No Copyrighted Content, No scripting for an advantage (they removed HTSL).
User: 
Bot: ## What does this mean for us?
User: Well.. I‚Äôm not too sure yet. Currently, FreeBuilds are no more primarily due to the ‚ÄúNo Copyrighted Content‚Äù rule, but these rules may change in the near future. One can hope anyway. I haven‚Äôt spoken with <@1250503193260200088> about this yet, but Meila's FB; FreeForm hostings will be cancelled until we learn what we can and can‚Äôt do. Hopefully we will be able to host in the future.
